This dir is to allow uninstalled copies of LisaEm
to find their resources on Linux and *BSD systems.

It should contain two links like so (incase git
strips them out)
lrwxrwxrwx  1 ray ray  12 Aug 30  2015 lisaem -> ../resources/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 ray ray  12 Jan 17  2018 LisaEm -> ../resources/

they are made like so:
ln -sf ../resources lisaem; ln -sf ../resources/ LisaEm
