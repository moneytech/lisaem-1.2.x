Lisa Emulator Change History                         http://lisaem.sunder.net/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 1.2.7    Released on (TBA) (Major release for all platforms)

2019.09.28 - fixed to 2x3y video mode

2019.09.25 - cleaning up source code and formatting
           - hunting down a power button issue that pauses the Lisa instead of
             powering it off.

2019.09.24 - Noticed weirdness between wx3.1.2 and earlier, wx3.1.2 rescales
             4k to 1080p automatically, and handles radio button menus 
             differently which will cause incompatibility issues.

2019.09.15 - got rid of most of the compilation warnings from most of the
             code

2019.09.07 - the display in my laptop died, so switched to a chromebook 
             running GalliumOS for development

2019.09.03 - added command line switch for zoom, i.e. -z1.50
           - changed fullscreen command line parameter to negateable:
             i.e. -F  or --fullscreen  enables fullscreen, 
                  -F- or --fullscreen- disables fullscreen

2019.08.19 - fixed a bunch of warnings
to   08.27 - moved skin settings to their own class

2019.08.06 - fixed some dumb bugs, time to refactor and clean up a bit more

2019.08.01 - Changed checkbox menu items to radio (*) where appropriate

2019.07.31 - fixed up more HiDPI issues

2019.07.30 - fixed up bunches of HiDPI induced display issues, but more to go
           - fixed a bug with sound playback

2019.07.02 - switch sound playback to RAM wave creation instead of /tmp
           - cleaned up reg68k_external_execute by moving debug code out
             to its own function
           - fixed a bunch of GUI bugs, not saving screen size, etc.
2019.06.06 - fixing GUI bugs - meh
2019.06.01 - fixed MMU bug caused by mmu_trans array not being auto-zero filled
2019.05.30 - removing some of the unused insetjumpland code/if statements

             { break; // - too busy with work, LisaList2, etc. }

2018.11.28 - added region grab in debug mode
           - removed File -> Run menu item to remove confusion between pause
             and run. User should use Key Power-On or click on power button

2018.11.23 - added mime64 encoder/decoder - has some minor termination bugs
             yes, I know wxWidgets has one, but I have other plans for this.

2018.10.15 - added screen rectangle grab in debug mode, output will be
             mime64 encoded.

2018.06.21 - more widget RE work; looking at Lisa's serial # as written to
             the MDDF, which is different than what's @240.  Added a
             better serial number decode function to floppy.c, but likely
             should move it elsewhere like glue.c or for 1.3 in the cpu
             board.

2018.05.24 - hq3x porting to LisaEm, widget protocol reverse engineering
             while the Widget ERS has much info, it doesn't have detail
             that I'd need a real widget and a protocol analyzer to get at.

2018.05.22 - control-q/q/Q will quit when not running an OS
           - Added command line options.
             -p, --power       	power on as soon as LisaEm is launched
             -f, --floppy=<str>	boot from which floppy image
             -d, --drive       	boot from motherboard ProFile/Widget
             -F, --fullscreen  	start in fullscreen mode
             -s, --skin        	turn on skin
             -S- --skin--      	turn off skin
             -c, --config=<str>	Open which lisaem config file

             { break - too busy with work }

2018.04.13 - Adding Widget support after discussions with Tom Stepleton and
             James MacPhail.  Turns out Widgets are quite a bit different
             from ProFiles!  See Widget_ERS.pdf on bitsavers for details.
             (While widgets can pretend to be a profile, they use a totally
             different protocol in native mode to xfer multiple blocks. Disks
             like the HD20, pippin, and Nisha have similar but also
             incompatible protocols, yeay, standards!) Many thanks to Tom
             Stepleton and Dr. Patrick Sch√§fer for providing Widget traces
             and dumps and sanity checking.

2018.04.04 - New feature, adding hq3x filter to improve display scaling on
             HiDPI displays, and also fixing Lisa's regtangular pixels.

2018.04.01 - seems LOS/LPW set the high byte of PC to the A-Line trap address
             and this doesn't seem to be an error.  Allowing bits 31-24 in PC
             to be set doesn't affect the execution of LOS/LPW at all. Infact
             it uses the A-Trap as an address to where it should jump to...
             [I swear this is not an April Fool's joke, though it should be!]
           - ipc cache invalidations now work across MMU contexts, i.e.
             supervisor mode (cx1) can load code into cx4, will now invalidate
             memory caches in both cx1 and cx4.
           - fixed a hidden ipc memory leak not caught by valgrind

2018.03.28 - paste would send LF as LF on Linux, replaced LF as a copy of CR
             so can paste code into LPW Editor now

2018.03.22 - added F-line wormholes to help track down bugs
           - cleaned cpu68k.c ipc, memory.c RAM code to make it more readable
             and more like the original using a few C macros.

2018.03.21 - fixed bad region refresh in AAG blit

2018.03.18 - wipe/free CPU IPCTs and memory on reboot

2018.03.14 - buserror bug manifests in LisaTest (2 disk version) as well
           - Fixed messagebox/yesnodialog from C (was showing blank dialog)
           - Stephen Hawking has left our universe, ever the joker, he 
             picked Pi day :(

2018.03.04 - Tom Stepleton discovered LisaMandlebrot zoom doesn't work in
             LisaEm, he wrote up a set up apps that do division and tripped
             the CPU bug that causes a weird bus error.  Getting closer on
             squashing this bug.

2018.03.04 - Collapsed Skins On/Off menu item into a single item
           - converted display scale and refresh menu items to submenus

2018.03.01 - added _H()/_N() array lookups for hidpi_scale acceleration

2018.02.28 - Parameterized skins so new ones can be made, but needs more work
           - Added skin debug #ifdefs to color display, floppy, power switch

2018.02.25 - added fullscreen display option, not sure about elsewhere, but
             on wxGTK menu is hidden and cannot be turned on/off without having
             to exit full screen and re-enter it which causes some nasty
             animation.  This is a bug in wxWidgets 3.1.x :(

2018.02.24 - v1.2.7 work started - added hidpi_scaling

2018.02.20 - fixed 2x3y and 2y video modes

2018.02.02 - Gilles discovered that writes to unused I/O space does not cause
             a bus error (via GemDOS), added this to LisaEm.  Thank you!

2017.11.xx - My 2011 Macbook pro 17" died with GPU failure, making switch to linux.
             Goodbye Apple. I miss Apple Computer, Inc. and user upgradeable
             products. Soldered in RAM, SSD, glued in batteries, walled gardens,
             stores, locked down operating systems, and other planned
             obsolescence anti-features are a deal breaker for me.

2016.02.16 - wxString patches from Zoltan Balaton, many thanks. :)


--- 1.2.6.2  Released on 2015.09.03  linux/raspbian fixes

--- 1.2.6.1  Released on 2015.08.29  linux/raspbian fixes

--- 1.2.6    Released on 2015.12.13 (Major release for all platforms)


2007.12.03 - fixed win32 rawbitmap issues, this should speed up the display
             quite a bit.  Linux rawbitmaps don't work yet, just show a blank
             white display.

2007.12.01 - fixed bugs on skinless on OS X.  Issue with wxBitmap, it needed
             to be filled in before using.  Some update to wxWidgets changed
             the default from the default being white, to an alpha background
             causing the whole display to fail to update at all since the
             data inside the wxBitmap was invisible.

           - bug report - libexpat was accidentally turned on in the OS X 
             version of LisaEm, this is not needed by LisaEm's use of 
             wxWidgets, it will be removed via  --without-expat in 
             wxWidgets' configure script.


--- 1.2.5    Released on 2007.11.25


2007.11.22 - imagewriter - fixed page size - at least for LisaWrite 

2007.11.21 - imagewriter lowercase letter "t" was broken

           - imagewriter page size tweaking

2007.11.18 - found way to make graphics smoother, added menu options to 
             throttle menu to define balance between animation and CPU time.


--- 1.2.2    Released on 2007.11.11


2007.11.08 - fixed slot preferences - browse buttons between high/low ports
             were swapped.

           - fixed parallel port u/l assignments - opposite from what LOS uses

2007.11.02 - more via6522.c cleanup/fixes.

2007.10.18 - Renamed Profile menu to Parallel Port as it's more accurate

2007.10.15 - cleaning up Generator code so as to build it as its own library

2007.10.01 - looking into cleaning up unicode incompatibility bugs, rewrote
             bunches and bunches of string routines and fixed up some idiotic
             char * <-> wxString gymnastics.

2007.09.25 - Looking into via6522 bugs for MacWorks and Xenix, 
             no luck there yet


--- 1.2.0    Release 


2007.09.19 - fixed romless floppy boot to always boot from floppy and not
             switch to Profile.

2007.09.15 - debugging ROMless boot.
             new bug: when trying to boot from floppy, if a profile exists
             and is bootable, LOS starts up from the Profile instead of the
             floppy.

2007.09.09 - David Cecchin's XPM icon in unix

2007.09.07 - added Save/Load PRAM to Preferences

           - Quit now closes any open Preference window as well

2007.08.29 - libdc42 macbinii encoded dart to dc42 conversion bugfix

2007.08.16 - added LOS error codes to ROMless error handler
		   - fix raw screenshot crash

2007.08.13 - got both ROMless boot and ROMless dual parallel card to work

2007.08.06 - individual profile power controls + create new profile inside
             a new menu named profile.

2007.07.28 - replaced all exit() and EXIT() calls with messages before
             quitting emulator so at least we know what crashed.

2007.07.27 - ROMless works with both profile and floppy now.

           - Fixed a bug with configuration saving.

2007.07.26 - Tracelog checkmark correction

2007.07.25 - added Zap PRAM button in main Preferences panel

2007.07.23 - ROMLess booting - floppy works

2007.07.19 - ROMLess booting start

2007.07.12 - RESET opcode supervisor mode bug fix.

2007.07.10 - CPU core tests


--- 1.0.0    Release


2007.07.06 - Display color balancing to remove fuzziness.

2007.07.05 - LisaConfig bugs found - overwriting date information with
             garbage on save of preferences.

           - corrected a bug preventing the grabbing of the host time and
             date.  Found that MacWorks locks up when date is invalid.

2007.07.04 - LisaEm documentation completion

2007.07.03 - Testing various opcodes to locate scroll bar arrow bug in LOS
	     not found, but eliminated shift/rotate opcodes.

2007.07.01 - regression testing to locate MacWorks bug - not found yet, high
             probability that it lives somewhere inside the C++ code.

2007.06.30 - added Mac OS trap symbol printing for A-Line traps for tracelog

2007.06.29 - fixed inability to detect no-floppy from Lisa boot ROM
           - fixed entry to Service mode - not perfect, need to attempt 
             to boot from bad profile.
           - fixed tracelog bugs (hardcoded /log/lisaem-output)

---          RC2 


2007.06.26 - fixes to build.sh for differences between platforms.

2007.06.22 - floppy de-serialization routines.

2007.06.20 - rawbmp.h code finally works - except crashes on win32. :-(

2007.06.13 - rawbmp.h code works, much, much faster!

2007.06.12 - wxImage::SetRGB works - faster than old blit code

2007.05.01 - integrating new wxui code is taking me too long becaue of a lack
             of free time, so I'm going to go the other way so as to be able
             to make a release soon.

2007.04.24 - Dual Parallel ROM cheat

2007.04.15 - Found OS X display slowdown issues
	
           - Fixed display sizing issues when skinless.

2007.04.14 - Fixed skins on/off switch on OS X

2007.04.13 - Debugging video system on OS X

2007.04.11 - Added Disk Copy 6.x detection to libdc42 open.  This allows
             better error messages to be returned.

2007.04.10 - Added MacBinII stripper to libdc42 auto_open

2007.04.09 - finalized buffered raw keycodes to compensate for repeats

           - decoupled the COPS 1/10th second timer from Lisa CPU and tied
             it to the host clock, clock is now accurate regardless of CPU
             speed.

2007.04.08 - added Unthrottled menu option for those who want to melt their
	         host computer. :-)

	       - added buffered raw keycodes to compensate for repeats.

2007.04.07 - bug with raw keycodes that prevents updates found and fixed.

2007.04.06 - Changes for OS X issues (might roll these back since Jerome
             Vernet found that the slowdown issues go away with wxWidgets
             2.7.2, will test on all platforms before committing to either
             path.)
           - reworked display to draw directly to dc and skip full blit
             only done for AntiAlias mode, need to redo for all others.
           - reworked timing loop to no longer need wxMilliSleep


--- RC 1     Released on 2007.04.04 


2007.04.04 - fixes to initial video position on skinless mode.
           - added 8Hz display refresh rate for slow hosts.
           - on shutdown throttle is removed + display refresh forced to 8Hz
             to compensate for ~Imagewriter slowdowns.

2007.04.02 - changes to build.sh to incorporate version #'s via #define
             and also modify Info.plist and _private.res inclusion on
             OS X and Win32.

2007.04.01 - Added Reset button
           - messing around with the VIA timing in hopes of fixing the
             extra-fast clock.  Helps, but still a bit too fast.
           - fixing OS X issues
           - switching skins is really broken on OS X, so switched it
             to will be done next time you run LisaEm.  This sucks,
             but it sucks less than having a broken display.
           - Printing on OS X works, but sometimes locks up LisaEm
             on shutdown.
           - windows now save their positions and restore on next boot

2007.03.30 - more printer work
           - timing correction: catch up on lost cycles if cpu<clock

2007.03.28 - some light via work - attempting to fix any discrepancies
             between via1/via2 (cops.c also contains via1_[i|o]ra().

2007.03.27 - printer work: changed printer wire plots to be rounder.
             got rid of horizontal gaps, but it turns out
             that there are protocol errors which cause two
             more bugs: pages are pre-maturely FF'ed, and
             horizontal data lines are lost on some lines.

2007.03.26 - with skins off, blacken whole screen instead to prevent artifacts
             except for OS X.
           - added option to completely hide the host mouse cursor.  It 
             surprisingly works better than I expected.
           - added Flush Printers menu item to force printouts to end
             once they're done.  Should also speed up shutdown since this
             happens there too.

2007.03.24 - James Savage of the Retro Mac Cast found these two bugs:
           - saving PNG screenshots are always grayscale.  Should be
             color for full screenshots.
           - power button on skin is triggered by just moving the
             mouse over the power button.  Fixed so click is required.
           - fixed some issues with switching between skins on/off.

2007.03.20 - pauses reported by Kallikak fixed, throttle mechanism rewritten
           - printing: added scale as some printerDC's are 600dpi and we
             work at 300dpi.

2007.03.18 - printing: fixing half page issues
           - fixed memory clobbering bug in printing code - caused profile
             corruption on linux since dc42's are mmap'ed, would have caused
             random issues elsewhere.

2007.03.17 - printing: fixed png background color issue
           - printing: pages were halved vertically, fixing this now but
             not quite right yet, only half a page makes it out
             now but it is the correct aspect ratio. 

2007.03.16 - added Refresh Rate to display menu: 60,20,12Hz. (Needs to be
             in odd multiplier of refresh rate, otherwise cursor in text
             fields will stop flashing)
           - Printing: tweaking color table in BMP generation as PNG's show 
             up with a gray background. (BMP's show up properly.)

2007.03.15 - fixed mouse/skin issues.
           - fixed some serial port issues, but still crashes emulator.   

2007.03.14 - skins initialization issues with skins on. caused mouse issues
             on startup.
           - skinless size increased as edges were getting cut off.
           - some z8530 fixes, but still does not properly work, causes LisaEm
             to quit.

2007.03.13 - found a fixed config bug: serial b options copied from port a.
           - added a switch to turn off power to the virtual Profile before
             power on.  This allows you to prevent the boot ROM's Power on
             self test to automatically boot from the Profile.  It's useful
             when you need to repair the Profile since it allows you to
             boot from "Lisa Office System 1/5" and then power on the
             Profile drive to repair the file system.

2007.03.11 - Proper BMP's are now generated for printing, conversion to PNG
             format works, but is a little bit off - background is gray,
             should be white as in paper white.
           - added command line ability to load preferences file when
             launching. i.e. ./lisaem ~ray/macworks.lisaem will open the
             macworks.lisaem preferences file from user ray's home.

2007.03.10 - getting closer on proper BMP generation for printing
           - added throttle setting to global preferences.
           - added ROM checksum failure warning on power on.  If the ROM is 
             broken, it can crash the emulator.

2007.03.09 - skins on/off added to Display menu.
           - found IW linefeed pixel bug (lack of initialization)

2007.03.08 - video modes are a bit smarter - if display size is too small, 
             will refuse to change video modes and will instead switch to 
             lower mode, or shut off skins.
           - re-enaled 2Y and 2X3Y video modes (skinless of course.) with 
             checks for display size.
           - skin/less mode switch no longer requires restart of emulator.  
             Extra space past display region is blackened to ameliorate window
             sizing bugs.
           - Preferences "Apply" button (was save in preview versions) closes
             Preferences window.

2007.03.06 - added skinless option (bug: size of window is too small/off). One 
             blit less during skinless mode so it's a bit faster on older 
             machines.
           - NMI key can be forced now.

2007.03.02 - Video mode, sound effects, asciikeyboard as globally saved prefs.
           - added Sound Effects checkbox.
           - debugging printing - somehow all pages show up black.

2007.03.01 - added NMI key to keyboard menu.

2007.02.28 - new IW code printouts sort of works.

2007.02.21 - Added Preferences panel for printer settings.

2007.02.20 - added size dialog box when creating profile (5/10MB, etc)

2007.02.18 - unified build.sh - because automake/autoconf sucks noodles

2007.02.05 - I/O ROM version was getting clobbered by code in floppy.c to 
             0xA8 via a #define.

2007.02.03 - cheat_ram_test now a preference.
           - if starting without ROM, dialogbox is shown, then preferences are
             shown asking for config.
           - bug fix: after closing preferences, re-opening caused segfault.
           - finer speed control - much closer.

2007.02.02 - fixed floppy insert on power off
           - fixed floppy trapping on insert of non-DC42/bad disk image.
           - fixed "Clock is not set" dialog box
           - fixed ContrastTrails (linx/win32)

2007.02.01 - fixed raw kb entry - but CPU clock is still too fast.

--- Preview Release 2007/01/28

2007.01.28   Fixes:
             - Fixes to libdc42 for profile access. Should be able to read and write to
               ProFile images to install Lisa Office System on a new disc.
             - Split ROM images are now supported - it will automatically merge them and
               save as *.ROM
             - Double-clicking on the mouse is now recognised in Lisa OS. This fix is a
               hack, and will need to be fixed properly in the future.
             - When quitting LisaEm on Mac OS X, the Preview Release used to crash. This
               has been fixed.
             - Crash on Restart from Lisa Office System Installer fixed.
             - Missing horizontal scrollbar on OS X seems to be fixed, but not sure why or
               how.
             - The duration of the click sound during the Lisa ROM tests was far too long,
               it now clicks rather than beeping.
             Known bugs:
             - Floppy animation does not work on OS X due to double buffering.
             - Floppy motor sounds and some other sounds do not work on OS X
             - Some light gray screen artifacts in the Windows build.
             - Still no documentation at all.

2007.01.24   Preview Release
             - No change notes, first release.
